# Openstack_billing_scripts
Bash scripts to output hourly billing values for CPU and RAM allocations by instance and project id/name from gnocchi in CSV format


Ensure the correct RC2/RC3 script has been run so that the openstack cli is connected to the correct environment. Edit the script and set the "start_date" and "end_date" varibles before running.

Output is in CSV ready for further processing.
